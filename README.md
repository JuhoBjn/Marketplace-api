# Marketplace API

This project is a simple online marketplace API created for a course in API development.
It allows the creation, editing and deleting of users and listings.

The API is made with Java and the Spring Boot framework. The database is made with PostgreSQL.
To interact with the database I used JPARepository and H2.
